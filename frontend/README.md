## üìã Overview

The Smart Mailbox Monitor is designed to add security to your mailbox and prevent mail theft. The system consists of a hardware device that attaches inside a standard mailbox and a web application for monitoring and configuration.

The hardware device uses sensors to detect:

- When mail is delivered
- When the mailbox is opened/closed
- When mail is removed
- It also captures images when these events occur

This repository contains the frontend web application that communicates with the hardware device through a cloud backend.
